# THRONG Research Protocol

**Read this at the start of every session, before touching code or interpreting any result.**
It is the distilled output of the Sep 2026 audit, in which thirteen defects were found that
each had one property in common: something reported success while doing nothing, and a
measurement was taken anyway.

---

## Part 1 — Code integrity: prove the work happened

A success message, a green test, an absent error and a plausible wall-clock time are all
compatible with nothing having occurred. Before believing any step did what it claims,
**measure an effect**.

- **Iteration counts.** Assert the loop body ran. `n // batch` is zero whenever `n < batch`,
  the loop silently skips, and the success line still prints. Degenerate cases must raise.
- **Coefficients.** A term multiplied by zero is dead. A live consumer reading state whose
  trainer is disabled is worse than dead — it is misleading.
- **Gradients.** Prove `‖∂loss/∂param‖ > 0` on real data at production shapes, per term, for
  each team. Keep *structural* (a raw gradient reaches the parameters at all) separate from
  *effective* (the coefficient-weighted, optimizer-applied delta matches config).
- **Declared but never written.** A state field can exist, be initialized, be read by
  consumers, and have no write site anywhere. Every state grid needs a proven write site.
- **Read but never used.** A config value can be loaded into a local that nothing references.
  Checking "is this key read?" misses it. Check that it reaches an effect.
- **In-bounds is not correct.** Index arithmetic that lands inside the right block is the
  hardest error to see. Derive offsets from the canonical layout function, never by hand.
- **Fixtures from production config.** Zero-arg constructors test dataclass defaults. A test
  that cannot fail when the live layout changes is decoration.
- **"Out of scope" is a decision, not an observation.** Noticing a defect while building on
  the exact thing it affects is not a neutral fact to log and move past — the scope question
  is already answered by the fact that you're standing inside it. `red_curriculum_idx` and
  `red_sustain_count` (plain Python locals, reset to zero on every process resume, never
  checkpointed) were noticed this way and scoped out once; the CtD competence ramp was then
  built on the identical unpersisted pattern, silently inheriting the same defect a second
  time (`THE-ECOLOGY-NEVER-RAN.md` #1). The noticing is the hard part. Don't spend it and then
  not act on it.

## Part 2 — Experiment integrity: is the experiment running at all?

Code that works is not an experiment that runs. These are separate failures and the second is
more expensive, because it produces publishable-looking nulls.

- **A configured mechanism is not a live mechanism.** Presence in `config.yaml` proves
  nothing. Every selection pressure must be confirmed by a *measured effect in a live
  rollout* before any result gathered under it is interpreted. Predation must produce
  catches. Crafting must produce successes.
- **Distinguish "tested and failed" from "never tested."** A null measured while the
  mechanism was inert is not evidence about the hypothesis. It is evidence about the
  apparatus. Six phases of receiver-side nulls turned out to be the latter.
- **Instrument failure modes before running.** A single `failed` counter cannot tell you
  whether the failure was logistical or informational. Partition every failure into causes
  that map onto different conclusions, or the result will be uninterpretable.
- **Pre-register bars, and never move them after seeing data.** Tightening on *external*
  evidence before a measurement is legitimate; loosening after is not. A marginal pass of a
  bar set in advance is suspicious, not successful. **Confirmed instance (2026-09-14):** Gate
  A's stop condition 3 was pre-registered as "dead-code resets still firing every update at
  production scale." Resets fired on nearly every update of the real launch, including a
  single update resetting 81% of total codebook capacity (51/56/48 of 64 per slot). Reported
  Gate A as clear by substituting a magnitude comparison against the pre-fix pathology (100-157
  fixed count every update, no variation) for the pre-registered criterion (fires every
  update) — a distinction that may turn out to be correct, but was introduced after seeing the
  data, by the same person who wrote this rule. Caught by Cam, not self-caught.
- **A threshold fitted to the observed distribution is not a threshold.** Adaptive cutoffs
  derived from the data they judge are p-hacking with extra steps.
- **Source beats prose.** Where documentation and code disagree, the code wins and the
  disagreement is itself a finding to record.

## Part 3 — Fossils

**A fossil is state carried forward through grafts and resumes that was trained under
conditions that no longer exist.** It is not random, not obviously broken, and it is
consulted every step as though it were current. Three confirmed instances:

- `head_confidence_1/2` — trained once in the Phase 9.1 era, frozen through every resume, and
  read by the epistemic gate to make real behavioural choices against an architecture that had
  since changed underneath it.
- **Blue's crafting-avoidance policy** — ~1.4M steps spent in a world where 3 of 5 crafting
  materials never spawned (flint/clay/vine grids declared but never written), so ~95.5% of
  recipes were unsatisfiable from the instant they were drawn. Blue correctly learned crafting
  was futile, because under those conditions it was. Confirmed as a fossil, not a ceiling, by
  the small-scale verification of the spawn fix (2026-09-13): the very first post-resume
  update — before dispersal, while the population was still randomly scattered rather than
  arranged by the trained policy — produced 27 real craft successes. Every update after, as
  agents re-converged on trained (avoidant) behavior, produced zero.
- **Red's hunting-avoidance policy** — trained under a reward signal where `reward_red_catch`
  was read from config and never wired into the advantage computation (Rule 13 #11); the only
  live reward was two dense, blue-position-independent per-step terms. Red correctly learned
  hunting was pointless, because it was never rewarded for it. The same first post-resume
  update produced 308 catches from the scattered starting population; every update since,
  under the (now-connected but not-yet-effective) reward, produced 0-6.

When an ecological defect is repaired, **the policy trained under the defect is a fossil of
it.** Expect it to behave as though the old world still holds, and expect no gradient to
correct it if the new opportunity is too rare to be discovered by exploration. This is the
sparse-reward coordination trap, and the project has already solved it once: the Phase 16 CtD
gate made Big Green solo-catchable so agents learned the value of the noun before facing the
cooperative friction that required the verb.

**Overwritten versus bypassed.** A competence ramp that temporarily eases a mechanism will
produce successes during the easy period — that is expected and is not evidence the fossil is
fixed, since it was engineered to be possible. The test is what happens *after* the ratchet
back to full difficulty: track **attempt rate**, not just success rate, in the window right
after. A genuinely repaired policy keeps attempting the mechanism at roughly the same rate it
did during the ramp, because it has learned the mechanism has positive expected value, even
though success gets harder again. A policy that only exploited the temporary window —
bypassed, not overwritten — shows attempt rate collapse back toward the pre-ramp fossil
baseline within a few updates of the ratchet, with nothing else in the environment having
changed. That collapse, or its absence, is the tell.

## Part 4 — Change discipline

- **One experimental variable at a time.** Corrections to confirmed defects may be bundled;
  treatments may not. State which is which in the log before the run.
- **Rule 12 stands:** ecological parameters need Cam's sign-off. Restoring a mechanism the
  design already specifies is implementation, not tuning — but say so explicitly when you do
  it.
- **Never adjust an ecological parameter to make a gate open.** That destroys the only clean
  test available.
- **Kill the class, not the instance.** Four hand-written mask sites produced two bugs; one
  shared constant and one shared function produced none.

## Part 5 — Reporting

Lead with what changes the reader's mind, then the supporting detail. The most consequential
finding of the audit arrived as an aside in the middle of a task narration.

Separate **confirmed defects** from **suspicions** and label which is which. Report what you
checked and found clean, so coverage is visible rather than assumed. When you find one
instance of a defect class, ask how many siblings it has — they cluster, because they come
from the same habits.
